# Precision-Agriculture-Dataset-Model
Our goal is to train and publish a neural network to identify weeds, acting as the foundation for visual scanners and utilized on agricultural robots as well as herbicide combines to differentiate wheat from weed when spraying herbicide, thereby decreasing glyphosate residue.

**What is our project about?**

Gluten intolerance, once a scientific mystery that now greater than 5% of the American population suffers from, has now been shown by studies to be a consequence of glyphosate, the active ingredient in common, non-selective herbicides. After collecting samples of multiple weeds native to the East Coast of the United States, we created our machine learning model using the software LOBE.

**How to use our data set?**

Our image set is comprised of both infrared and RGB photographs. The "Favorites" folder are ideal photographs to train neural networks on- even exposure (no shadows or overexposure), high contrast in the infrared photo, and the absence of external objects. "Faulty" photographs are the opposite. Both can be used to train complex neural networks.
